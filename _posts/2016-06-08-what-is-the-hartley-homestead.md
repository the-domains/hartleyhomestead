# What is the Hartley Homestead?

Well, officially--nothing yet. But _do _hold your breath because soon The Hartley Homestead will be born as we welcome two beautiful blue-eyed white English angora rabbits into our lives. First comes love, then comes bunnies, then comes _you, _lonely and hoping for one of our buns to fill the gap! We're hoping this will be the start of a beautiful new chapter in our lives, one filled with eco-sustainability and fluff. ![copyright 2016 The Fabrizio Forever Rabbitry](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/39b15f73-bb2f-4b6c-bfeb-40342e92cd4d.jpg)
